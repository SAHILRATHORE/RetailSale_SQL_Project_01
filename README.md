# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project
## Project Overview

# Project Title: Retail Sales Analysis

This project demonstrates SQL skills applied in a practical business scenario involving retail data. It showcases how to set up a database, perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answer real-world business questions using SQL. Itâ€™s an excellent entry-level project for data analysis using relational databases.

## Objectives
Database Setup: Create and populate a retail sales database.

Data Cleaning: Detect and remove records with missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand data distributions, categories, and customer segments.

Business Insights: Write SQL queries to extract valuable business intelligence from the sales data.

## Project Structure
1. Database Setup
Database: p1_retail_db

Table: retail_sales with fields such as transaction ID, sale date/time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity, price, COGS, and total sale.

2. Data Cleaning & Exploration
Key queries used to:

Count total records and customers

Identify distinct product categories

Find and remove rows with NULL values

3. Business Insights (SQL Queries)
Examples of the insights extracted:

Sales on a specific date

High-volume clothing sales in November 2022

Total sales by category

Average age of beauty product customers

Transactions with total sales over 1000

Transaction count by gender and category

Top 5 customers by total sales

Monthly sales trends and top-selling months

Unique customers per category

Sales shift segmentation (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)

Popular Categories: Clothing and Beauty emerged as popular product types.

Top Customers: Identified high-value customers based on total spend.

Seasonal Insights: Monthly sales trends helped highlight best-selling periods.

Customer Segments: Analysis showed engagement across diverse age groups and genders.
